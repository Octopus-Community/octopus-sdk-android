# Octopus SDK Android Sample - SSO Octopus Profile

All profile fields are managed by Octopus Community. This means that the info you provide in
the connectUser are only used as prefilled values when the user creates its community profile.
After that, they are not synchronized between your app and the community profile.

## In order to test this scenario:

- your community should be configured to use SSO authentication
- your community should be configured to have no app managed fields
